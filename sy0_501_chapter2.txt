Chapter 2: Understanding Identity and Access Management

Exploring Authentication Concepts:

Authentication - allows entitites to prove their identities through the use of credentials known to other identities
Identification - user claims or professes identity such as with a username, email address, PIV card, or biometrics
Authentication occurs when entity provides proof of an identify such as username or password
	Second Identity - authenticator and verifies the authentication
Authorization - provides access to resources based on proven identity
Accounting methods track user activity and record the activity in logs

Five Factors of Authentication:
	something you know - username/password
	something you have - smart card, CAC, PIV, or token
	something you are - biometrics such as fingerprints or retina scans
	somewhere you are - geolocation, computer name, or MAC address
	something you do - gestures on touch screen
	
Password or PIN is least secure form of authentication (something you know)
Passwords should be strong and changed often...complex passwords include multiple character types (number, lowercase, special character, uppercase) and at least 14 characters long

Administrators should verify user identity before resetting password...when resetting manually, should configure password as temporary and force new password upon next successful login
Password policies require users to create complex passwords
Password length is the minimum number of characters in password
Password complexity ensures passwords are complex and include 3 of the 4 character types (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
Password history prevents users from using previous passwords
Minimum password age - used to prevent users from changing password repeatedly to use the original password
Maximum password age or expiration forces users to change password periodically...when admin resets password, password should expire on first use
Password policies should apply to entity using password...includes user accounts and service accounts
Account lockout policies - lock account after too many bad password attempts

Smart Cards - credit card sized cards that include embedded certificates use for authentication...require PKI to issue certificates
Commmon Access Cards (CAC) and Personal Identity Verification (PVI) cards can be used as photo IDs and as smart cards (identification and authentication)
Tokens (Key Fobs) dispaly numbers in LCD...provide rolling one-time passwords and synchronized with a server...USB tokens include embedded chip and USB connection...called hardware tokens
HOTP and TOTP - open-sourced standards for one-time-use passwords
	HOTP creates one-time-use password that does not expire (HMAC-based...Hash-based Message Authentication)
	TOTP creates one-time-use password that expires every 30 seconds (Time-based)
Biometrics - most difficult to falsify...physical methods include voice and facial recognition, fingerprints, retina scans, iris scans, and palm scans...can be used for identification

False-Acceptance Rate (FAR)...aka false match rate...identifies percentage of times false acceptance occurs
False-Rejection Rate (FRR)...aka false nonmatch rate...identifies percentage of times false rejections occurs
Crossover Error Rate (CER)...indicates quality of biometric systems...lower the better

Single-factor authentication - password or PIN
Dual-factor authentication (2-factor) - uses two factors such as password and token
Multi-factor authentication - uses two or more factors...stronger than single factor obviously
Authentication methods using two or more methods in same factor still considered single-factor authentication (ex. password and PIN)



Comparing Authentication Services:

Kerberos - network authentication protocol using tickets (TGT) issued by KDC or TGT server
	Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) expires, user might not be able to access resources
	AD and Unix realms use Kerberos for authentication
LDAP uses special formats and methods to query directories...single point of management for objects (i.e. users and computers)
LDAPS encrypts transmissions with TLS or SSL
Single Sign-on (SSO) allows users to authenticate with a single user account and access multiple resources on a network without authenticating again
SAML - XML based standard to exchange authentication and authorization information between parties (IDP and SDP)...used with web-based applications
Federated Identity - links users credentials from different networks or OSs but federation treats as one identity
Shibboleth - open-source federated identity solution that includes Open SAML libraries
OAuth and OpenID Connect - streamlines authentication for many websites


Managing Accounts:

Principle of Least Privilege - technical control using access controls...grant individuals only the rights needed to perform their job function
Users should not share accounts...ensure guest account is disabled
Most administrators should have two accounts...general user account for everyday activities...admin account for making changes
Accound disablement policy ensures inactive accounts are disabled
Time restrictions - prevent logons or accessing network resources during specific hours
Location-based restrictions - prevent logons from certain locations
Accounst should recertify to verify still required
Credential Management Systems - store and simplify use of credentials for users (LastPass)


Comparing Access Models:

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) - grants access by placing users in roles based on job duties, functions or tasks...use matrix matching job titles with required priviliges 
Group-based Priviliges - similar to RBAC...creates groups...adds users to groups...then assign permissions to groups
Rule-based Access Control (RBAC) - uses approved rules  such as ACLs
Discretionary Access Model (DAC) - every object is an owner...NTFS uses this model...susceptible to Trojan horses
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) - uses security or sensitive lables to idnetify objects and subjects...restricted based on need to know
Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) - evaluates attributes and grants access based on the value of attributes...SDNs
