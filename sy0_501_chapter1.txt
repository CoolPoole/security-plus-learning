Notes:

Components of a Use Case:
Actors - individual(s) involved
Preconditions - must occur before the process can start
Trigger - starts the use case
Post Condition - occurs after the actor triggers the process
Normal flow - list of steps in a specific order
Alternate flow - occurs when actions are not the same order as normal flow

Access Controls:
Identification
Authentication
Authorization

MAC:
Media Access Control - physical addresses of NICs
Mandatory Access Control - access control model
Message Authentication Code - provides integrity similar to how hash is used 

Hashing:
You know data has changed if the hash is different than original hash
Doesn't tell you who modified the data but only that data has changed
Types of algorithms are MD5, SHA, and HMAC

Key Concepts related to Integrity:
Integrity provides assurances that data has not been modified, tampered with, or corrupted
Hashing verifies integrity

Fault Tolerant and Redundancy Techniques:
Disk Redundancy - RAID
Server Redundancy - failover clusters
Load Balancing - F5, Netscaler
Site Redundancies - hot/cold/warm sites
Backups
Alternate Power - UPS, generators
Cooling Systems - heating, ventilation, HVAC systems

Using encryption can increase the size of the file as well as use more memory and CPU resources to decrypt and re-encypt

Threats can come from inside organization (disgruntled employee) or outside organization (malicious actor)
Threats can be natural (hurricane), manmade (malware)
Threats can be intentional(attacker) or accidental (employee mistake)

You can reduce risk by implementing controls 

Control Types:
Technical (how implemented) - use technology
Administrative (how implemented) - use administrative or management methods
Physical (how implemented) - controls that you can physically touch
Preventive (goals of security control) - attempt to prevent an incident from occurring
Detective (goals of security control) - detect incidents after they have occured
Corrective (goals of security controls) - reverse the impact of an incident
Deterrent (goals of security controls) - discourage individuals from causing an incident
Compensating (goals of security controls) - alternate controls used when primary control is not feasible

Technical Controls:
Encryption
Antivirus Software
IDS/IPS
Firewalls
Least Privilege

Administrative Controls:
Risk Assessments
Vulnerability Assessments
Penetration Tests
Awareness and Training
Configuration and Change Management
Contigency Planning
Media Protection
Physical and Environmental Protection 

Control Goals:
Preventive Controls - hardening, security training, security guards, change management, account disablement policy
Detective Controls - log monitoring, trend analysis, security audit, video surveillance, motion detection
Corrective Controls - IPS, backups and system recovery
Deterrent Controls - cable locks, hardware locks
Compensating Controls - using one-time password instead of a smart card due to new employee ramp up 

Virtualization:
Hypervisor - creates, runs, manages VMs on single host (Virtualbox, Hyper-V, VMware)
Host - phsyical system hosting VMs (ESXi)
Guest - OS running on host system (guests and guest machines)
Host elasticity and scalability

Type I Hypervisor - ESXi...can run on bare metal
Type II Hypervisor - software within an OS like Hyper-V running on Windows Server OS 
App Cell or Containers - shares a kernal OS and all cells/containers must run the same OS 

Snapshots - copy of VM at a moment in time

VDI - Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
VDE - Virtual Desktop Environment
Non-Persistent - VM returns to the base configuration once user is done with it
VM Escape - allows attacker to attack host system from within VM
VM Sprawl - no properly managing VMs and they become unruly 

VMs are just files so they can be copied and moved should an employee become disgruntled and they include all the data 

Various Tools to Use:
ping - checks network connectivity, tests NIC, resolve hostnames, security posture
	ping <ip address>  Windows: use ping <ip address> -t (continuous) Linux: ping -c 4 <ip address> (4 packets sent)
ipconfig - windows
	ipconfig /all - all the info
	ipconfig /displaydns - show the DNS cache
	ipconfig /flushdns - flush DNS cache
ifconfig - linux (depreciated)
	ifconfig eth0 - show configuration of first ethernet interface
	ifconfig eth0 promisc - allows the first NIC to process all traffic that is sent to the device
	ifconfig eth0 allmulti - enables multicast mode on first ethernet interface 
ip - linux...recommeded since ifconfig is deprecated
	ip link show - show the interfaces and details
	ip link set eth0 up - enables a network interface 
	ip -s link - statistics on netowrk interface
netstat - allows you to view statistics for TCP/IP protocols on a system
	netstat -a - displays all TCP and UDP ports that a system is listening on
	netstat -r - displays routing table
	netstat -s - displays stats of packets sent or received for specific protocols
	netstat -n - diplays addresses and port numbers in numerical order 
	netstat -p <protocol> - show stats on specific protocol 

	ESTABLISHED - normal state...connection
	LISTEN - waiting for a connection
	CLOSE_WAIT - waiting for connection termination
	TIME_WAIT - waiting on remote connection to indicate they received the ACK packet 
	SYN_SENT - sent SYN packet and waiting on SYN-ACK
	SYN_RECEIVED - waiting on ACK packet
tracert - windows...shows router hops
traceroute - linux...shows router hops
arp - maps IP address (Layer 3) to MAC addresses (Layer 2)...show arp cache 


Remember This:

Confidentiality ensures that data is only viewable by authorized users
Best way to protect confidentialiy of data is via encryption
Access controls help ensure confidentialty by restricting access
Steganography helps provide confidentialiy by hiding data such as hiding text files in images

Integrity verifies the data has not changed
Loss of integrity can occur via unauthorized or unintended changes (db update)
Hashing algorithms calculate hashes to verify integrity
Comparing hashes, you can verify integrity has been maintained

Digital Signatures verify integrity of emails and files
Digital Signatures also provide authentication and non-repudiation
Digital Signatures require use of certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Cerficates include keys for encryption
PKI provides way to create, manage, and distribute certificates

Risk is the likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability
Risk Mitigation reduces the changes that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, or reduces impact of the risk by implementing security controls

Most security controls can be classified as technical, administrative, or physical

Preventive controls attempt to prevent security incidents
Hardening systems increase basic configuration to prevent incidents
Security Guards prevent unauthorized personnel from entering a secure area
Change Management processes help prevent outages from configuration changes
Account disablement policy ensures that accounts are disabled when a user leaves the organization
Detective Controls detect when vulnerabilities have been exploited
